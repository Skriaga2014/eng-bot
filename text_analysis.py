txt = """There is no lake at Camp Green Lake. There once was a very large lake here, the
largest lake in Texas. That was over a hundred years ago. Now it is just a dry, flat
wasteland.
There used to be a town of Green Lake as well. The town shriveled and dried up
along with the lake, and the people who lived there.
During the summer the daytime temperature hovers around ninety-five degrees in
the shade— if you can find any shade. There's not much shade in a big dry lake.
The only trees are two old oaks on the eastern edge of the "lake." A hammock is
stretched between the two trees, and a log cabin stands behind that.
The campers are forbidden to lie in the hammock. It belongs to the Warden. The
Warden owns the shade.
Out on the lake, rattlesnakes and scorpions find shade under rocks and in the holes
dug by the campers.
Here's a good rule to remember about rattlesnakes and scorpions: If you don't
bother them, they won't bother you.
Usually.
Being bitten by a scorpion or even a rattlesnake is not the worst thing that can
happen to you. You won't die.
Usually.
Sometimes a camper will try to be bitten by a scorpion, or even a small rattlesnake.
Then he will get to spend a day or two recovering in his tent, instead of having to dig a
hole out on the lake
But you don't want to be bitten by a yellow-spotted lizard. That's the worst thing
that can happen to you. You will die a slow and painful death.
Always.
If you get bitten by a yellow-spotted lizard, you might as well go into the shade of
the oak trees and lie in the hammock.
There is nothing anyone can do to you anymore.

The reader is probably asking: Why would anyone go to Camp Green Lake?
Most campers weren't given a choice. Camp Green Lake is a camp for bad boys.
If you take a bad boy and make him dig a hole every day in the hot sun, it will turn
him into a good boy.
That was what some people thought.

3
Stanley Yelnats was given a choice. The judge said, "You may go to jail, or you
may go to Camp Green Lake."
Stanley was from a poor family. He had never been to camp before.

3
Stanley Yelnats was the only passenger on the bus, not counting the driver or the
guard The guard sat next to the driver with his seat turned around facing Stanley A rifle
lay across his lap
Stanley was sitting about ten rows back, handcuffed to his armrest His backpack lay
on the seat next to him It contained his toothbrush, toothpaste, and a box of stationery
his mother had given him He'd promised to write to her at least once a week.
He looked out the window, although there wasn't much to see— mostly fields of hay
and cotton. He was on a long bus ride to nowhere The bus wasn't air-conditioned, and
the hot, heavy air was almost as stifling as the handcuffs.
Stanley and his parents had tried to pretend that he was just going away to camp for
a while, just like rich kids do. When Stanley was younger he used to play with stuffed
animals, and pretend the animals were at camp. Camp Fun and Games he called it.
Sometimes he'd have them play soccer with a marble. Other times they'd run an
obstacle course, or go bungee jumping off a table, tied to broken rubber bands. Now
Stanley tried to pretend he was going to Camp Fun and Games Maybe he'd make some
friends, he thought. At least he'd get to swim in the lake.
He didn't have any friends at home. He was overweight and the kids at his middle
school often teased him about his size. Even his teachers sometimes made cruel
comments without realizing it. On his last day of school, his math teacher, Mrs Bell,
taught ratios. As an example, she chose the heaviest kid in the class and the lightest kid
m the class, and had them weigh themselves. Stanley weighed three times as much as
the other boy Mrs. Bell wrote the ratio on the board, 3:1, unaware of how much
embarrassment she had caused both of them.
Stanley was arrested later that day.
He looked at the guard who sat slumped in his seat and wondered if he had fallen
asleep. The guard was wearing sunglasses, so Stanley couldn't see his eyes.
Stanley was not a bad kid. He was innocent of the crime for which he was convicted
He'd just been in the wrong place at the wrong time.
It was all because of his no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather!
He smiled. It was a family joke. Whenever anything went wrong, they always
blamed Stanley's no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather.
Supposedly, he had a great-great-grandfather who had stolen a pig from a
one-legged Gypsy, and she put a curse on him and all his descendants. Stanley and his
parents didn't believe in curses, of course, but whenever anything went wrong, it felt
good to be able to blame someone
Things went wrong a lot. They always seemed to be in the wrong place at the wrong
time.

He looked out the window at the vast emptiness. He watched the rise and fall of a
telephone wire. In his mind he could hear his father's gruff voice softly singing to him
"If only, if only," the woodpecker sighs,
"The bark on the tree was just a little bit softer."
While the wolf waits below, hungry and lonely,
He cries to the moo— oo— oon,
"If only, if only."
It was a song his father used to sing to him. The melody was sweet and sad, but
Stanley's favorite part was when his father would howl the word "moon "
The bus hit a small bump and the guard sat up, instantly alert.
Stanley's father was an inventor. To be a successful inventor you need three things:
intelligence, perseverance, and just a little bit of luck.
Stanley's father was smart and had a lot of perseverance. Once he started a project
he would work on it for years, often going days without sleep. He just never had any
luck.
Every time an experiment failed, Stanley could hear him cursing his
dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-grandfather.
Stanley's father was also named Stanley Yelnats. Stanley's father's full name was
Stanley Yelnats III. Our Stanley is Stanley Yelnats IV.
Everyone in his family had always liked the fact that "Stanley Yelnats" was spelled
the same frontward and backward. So they kept naming their sons Stanley. Stanley was
an only child, as was every other Stanley Yelnats before him.
All of them had something else in common. Despite their awful luck, they always
remained hopeful. As Stanley's father liked to say, "I learn from failure."
But perhaps that was part of the curse as well. If Stanley and his father weren't
always hopeful, then it wouldn't hurt so much every time their hopes were crushed.
"Not every Stanley Yelnats has been a failure," Stanley's mother often pointed out,
whenever Stanley or his father became so discouraged that they actually started to
believe in the curse. The first Stanley Yelnats, Stanley's great-grandfather, had made a
fortune m the stock market. "He couldn't have been too unlucky."
At such times she neglected to mention the bad luck that befell the first Stanley
Yelnats. He lost his entire fortune when he was moving from New York to California.
His stagecoach was robbed by the outlaw Kissin' Kate Barlow.
If it weren't for that, Stanley's family would now be living in a mansion on a beach
in California. Instead, they were crammed in a tiny apartment that smelled of burning
rubber and foot odor.
If only, if only . . .
The apartment smelled the way it did because Stanley's father was trying to invent a
way to recycle old sneakers. "The first person who finds a use for old sneakers," he said,
"will be a very rich man."
It was this latest project that led to Stanley's arrest.
The bus ride became increasingly bumpy because the road was no longer paved.

Actually, Stanley had been impressed when he first found out that his
great-grandfather was robbed by Kissin' Kate Barlow. True, he would have preferred
living on the beach in California, but it was still kind of cool to have someone in your
family robbed by a famous outlaw.
Kate Barlow didn't actually kiss Stanley's great-grandfather. That would have been
really cool, but she only kissed the men she killed. Instead, she robbed him and left him
stranded in the middle of the desert.
"He was lucky to have survived," Stanley's mother was quick to point out.
The bus was slowing down. The guard grunted as he stretched his arms.
"Welcome to Camp Green Lake," said the driver.
Stanley looked out the dirty window. He couldn't see a lake.
And hardly anything was green.

Stanley felt somewhat dazed as the guard unlocked his handcuffs and led him off
the bus. He'd been on the bus for over eight hours.
"Be careful," the bus driver said as Stanley walked down the steps.
Stanley wasn't sure if the bus driver meant for him to be careful going down the
steps, or if he was telling him to be careful at Camp Green Lake. "Thanks for the ride,"
he said. His mouth was dry and his throat hurt. He stepped onto the hard, dry dirt. There
was a band of sweat around his wrist where the handcuff had been.
The land was barren and desolate. He could see a few rundown buildings and some
tents. Farther away there was a cabin beneath two tall trees. Those two trees were the
only plant life he could see. There weren't even weeds.
The guard led Stanley to a small building. A sign on front said, YOU ARE
ENTERING CAMP GREEN LAKE JUVENILE CORRECTIONAL FACILITY. Next
to it was another sign which declared that it was a violation of the Texas Penal Code to
bring guns, explosives, weapons, drugs, or alcohol onto the premises.
As Stanley read the sign he couldn't help but think, Well, duh!
The guard led Stanley into the building, where he felt the welcome relief of
air-conditioning.
A man was sitting with his feet up on a desk. He turned his head when Stanley and
the guard entered, but otherwise didn't move. Even though he was inside, he wore
sunglasses and a cowboy hat. He also held a can of soda, and the sight of it made
Stanley even more aware of his own thirst.
He waited while the bus guard gave the man some papers to sign.
"That's a lot of sunflower seeds," the bus guard said
Stanley noticed a burlap sack filled with sunflower seeds on the floor next to the
desk.
"I quit smoking last month," said the man in the cowboy hat. He had a tattoo of a
rattlesnake on his arm, and as he signed his name, the snake's rattle seemed to wiggle "I
used to smoke a pack a day. Now I eat a sack of these every week "

The guard laughed.
There must have been a small refrigerator behind his desk, because the man in the
cowboy hat produced two more cans of soda. For a second Stanley hoped that one
might be for him, but the man gave one to the guard and said the other was for the
driver.
"Nine hours here, and now nine hours back," the guard grumbled. "What a day."
Stanley thought about the long, miserable bus ride and felt a little sorry for the
guard and the bus driver.
The man in the cowboy hat spit sunflower seed shells into a wastepaper basket.
Then he walked around the desk to Stanley. "My name is Mr. Sir," he said "Whenever
you speak to me you must call me by my name, is that clear?"
Stanley hesitated. "Uh, yes, Mr. Sir," he said, though he couldn't imagine that was
really the man's name.
"You're not in the Girl Scouts anymore," Mr. Sir said.
Stanley had to remove his clothes in front of Mr. Sir, who made sure he wasn't
hiding anything. He was then given two sets of clothes and a towel. Each set consisted
of a long-sleeve orange jumpsuit, an orange T-shirt, and yellow socks. Stanley wasn't
sure if the socks had been yellow originally.
He was also given white sneakers, an orange cap, and a canteen made of heavy
plastic, which unfortunately was empty. The cap had a piece of cloth sewn on the back
of it, for neck protection.
Stanley got dressed. The clothes smelled like soap.
Mr. Sir told him he should wear one set to work in and one set for relaxation.
Laundry was done every three days. On that day his work clothes would be washed.
Then the other set would become his work clothes, and he would get clean clothes to
wear while resting.
"You are to dig one hole each day, including Saturdays and Sundays. Each hole
must be five feet deep, and five feet across in every direction. Your shovel is your
measuring stick. Breakfast is served at 4:30."
Stanley must have looked surprised, because Mr. Sir went on to explain that they
started early to avoid the hottest part of the day. "No one is going to baby-sit you," he
added. "The longer it takes you to dig, the longer you will be out in the sun. If you dig
up anything interesting, you are to report it to me or any other counselor. When you
finish, the rest of the day is yours."
Stanley nodded to show he understood.
"This isn't a Girl Scout camp," said Mr. Sir.
He checked Stanley's backpack and allowed him to keep it. Then he led Stanley
outside into the blazing heat.
"Take a good look around you," Mr. Sir said. "What do you see?"
Stanley looked out across the vast wasteland. The air seemed thick with heat and
dirt. "Not much," he said, then hastily added, "Mr. Sir."
Mr. Sir laughed. "You see any guard towers?"
"No."

"How about an electric fence?"
"No, Mr. Sir."
"There's no fence at all, is there?"
"No, Mr. Sir."
"You want to run away?" Mr. Sir asked him.
Stanley looked back at him, unsure what he meant.
"If you want to run away, go ahead, start running. I'm not going to stop you."
Stanley didn't know what kind of game Mr. Sir was playing.
"I see you're looking at my gun. Don't worry. I'm not going to shoot you." He tapped
his holster. "This is for yellow-spotted lizards. I wouldn't waste a bullet on you."
"I'm not going to run away," Stanley said.
"Good thinking," said Mr. Sir. "Nobody runs away from here. We don't need a
fence. Know why? Because we've got the only water for a hundred miles. You want to
run away? You'll be buzzard food in three days."
Stanley could see some kids dressed in orange and carrying shovels dragging
themselves toward the tents.
"You thirsty?" asked Mr. Sir.
"Yes, Mr. Sir," Stanley said gratefully.
"Well, you better get used to it. You're going to be thirsty for the next eighteen
months."

There were six large gray tents, and each one had a black letter on it: A, B, C, D, E,
or F. The first five tents were for the campers. The counselors slept in F.
Stanley was assigned to D tent. Mr. Pendanski was his counselor.
"My name is easy to remember," said Mr. Pendanski as he shook hands with
Stanley just outside the tent. "Three easy words: pen, dance, key."
Mr. Sir returned to the office.
Mr. Pendanski was younger than Mr. Sir, and not nearly as scary looking. The top
of his head was shaved so close it was almost bald, but his face was covered in a thick
curly black beard. His nose was badly sunburned.
"Mr. Sir isn't really so bad," said Mr. Pendanski. "He's just been in a bad mood ever
since he quit smoking. The person you've got to worry about is the Warden. There's
really only one rule at Camp Green Lake: Don't upset the Warden."
Stanley nodded, as if he understood.
"I want you to know, Stanley, that I respect you," Mr. Pendanski said. "I understand
you've made some bad mistakes in your life. Otherwise you wouldn't be here. But
everyone makes mistakes. You may have done some bad things, but that doesn't mean
you're a bad kid."
Stanley nodded. It seemed pointless to try and tell his counselor that he was
innocent. He figured that everyone probably said that. He didn't want Mr.
Pen-dance-key to think he had a bad attitude.

"I'm going to help you turn your life around," said his counselor. "But you're going
to have to help, too. Can I count on your help?"
"Yes, sir," Stanley said.
Mr. Pendanski said, "Good," and patted Stanley on the back.
Two boys, each carrying a shovel, were coming across the compound. Mr.
Pendanski called to them. "Rex! Alan! I want you to come say hello to Stanley. He's the
newest member of our team."
The boys glanced wearily at Stanley.
They were dripping with sweat, and their faces were so dirty that it took Stanley a
moment to notice that one kid was white and the other black.
"What happened to Barf Bag?" asked the black kid.
"Lewis is still in the hospital," said Mr. Pendanski. "He won't be returning." He told
the boys to come shake Stanley's hand and introduce themselves, "like gentlemen."
"Hi," the white kid grunted.
"That's Alan," said Mr. Pendanski.
"My name's not Alan," the boy said. "It's Squid. And that's X-Ray."
"Hey," said X-Ray. He smiled and shook Stanley's hand. He wore glasses, but they
were so dirty that Stanley wondered how he could see out of them.
Mr. Pendanski told Alan to go to the Rec Hall and bring the other boys to meet
Stanley. Then he led him inside the tent.
There were seven cots, each one less than two feet from the one next to it.
"Which was Lewis's cot?" Mr. Pendanski asked.
"Barf Bag slept here," said X-Ray, kicking at one of the beds.
"All right, Stanley, that'll be yours," said Mr. Pendanski.
Stanley looked at the cot and nodded. He wasn't particularly thrilled about sleeping
in the same cot that had been used by somebody named Barf Bag.
Seven crates were stacked in two piles at one side of the tent. The open end of the
crates faced outward. Stanley put his backpack, change of clothes, and towel in what
used to be Barf Bag's crate. It was at the bottom of the stack that had three in it.
Squid returned with four other boys. The first three were introduced by Mr.
Pendanski as Jose, Theodore, and Ricky. They called themselves Magnet, Armpit, and
Zigzag.
"They all have nicknames," explained Mr. Pendanski. "However, I prefer to use the
names their parents gave them— the names that society will recognize them by when
they return to become useful and hardworking members of society."
"It ain't just a nickname," X-Ray told Mr. Pendanski. He tapped the rim of his
glasses. "I can see inside you, Mom. You've got a big fat heart."
The last boy either didn't have a real name or else he didn't have a nickname. Both
Mr. Pendanski and X-Ray called him Zero.
"You know why his name's Zero?" asked Mr. Pendanski. "Because there's nothing
inside his head." He smiled and playfully shook Zero's shoulder.
Zero said nothing.
"And that's Mom!" a boy said.

Mr. Pendanski smiled at him. "If it makes you feel better to call me Mom, Theodore,
go ahead and call me Mom." He turned to Stanley. "If you have questions, Theodore
will help you. You got that, Theodore. I'm depending on you."
Theodore spit a thin line of saliva between his teeth, causing some of the other boys
to complain about the need to keep their "home" sanitary.
"You were all new here once," said Mr. Pendanski, "and you all know what it feels
like. I'm counting on every one of you to help Stanley."
Stanley looked at the ground.
Mr. Pendanski left the tent, and soon the other boys began to file out as well, taking
their towels and change of clothes with them. Stanley was relieved to be left alone, but
he was so thirsty he felt as if he would die if he didn't get something to drink soon.
"Hey, uh, Theodore," he said, going after him. "Do you know where I can fill my
canteen?"
Theodore whirled and grabbed Stanley by his collar. "My name's not Thee-o-dore,"
he said. "It's Armpit." He threw Stanley to the ground.
Stanley stared up at him, terrified.
"There's a water spigot on the wall of the shower stall."
"Thanks . . . Armpit," said Stanley.
As he watched the boy turn and walk away, he couldn't for the life of him figure out
why anyone would want to be called Armpit.
In a way, it made him feel a little better about having to sleep in a cot that had been
used by somebody named Barf Bag. Maybe it was a term of respect."""
